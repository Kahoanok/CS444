\maketitle

We plan to modified the the dispatch and add functions from the original noop 
scheduler to implement the LOOK algorithm for the scheduler. We made it so that 
you can go both forward and backward in the dispatch function when finding the 
next request to dispatch. If the distance to a request in the opposite 
direction is closer than a request in the current direction the direction will 
change. The queue sorted after a request has been dispatched. If the queue is 
empty then we add the new requests directly to the queue. If there is already 
requests in the queue then when adding then we sort during the insertion. the 
requests are inserted into the queue based on position.

\section{Main point of the assignment}
We believe that the main point of the assignment was to understand how requests 
are dealt with in an operating system. It was also begin to understand how to 
interact with the kernel. 

\section{How we approached the problem}
First we started by figuring out how to get our scheduler working with the kernel 
instead of the noop scheduler. Once we were able to do that we began to figure 
out how we were going to implement the look schedluer. We knew we needed to be 
able move forward and backward and that there needed to be two sorts. First we 
firgured out how to get the forward and backward working by checking if the the 
next request in the direction that we were currently going is closer than the 
next request in the oppsite direction. If it was closer than we continue in that 
direction and if it was futher away then we change direction and go to the closer 
request. After a request is dispatched then we will re-sort the queue. We also 
needed to modify the add function so that we would sort the requests as they were 
inserted into the queue. We did this by using an insertion sort as requests were 
added into the queue.

\section{Correctness and Testing}
We know that our secheduler was being used because we used the command

cat /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler

and got an output

noop [sstf] deadline cfq

this shows that our sstf scheduler is being used as we wanted. We then 
added print statements to our scheduler code so that we could determine 
when requests were being added and dispatched from the queue and by doing 
this we were able to show that for every requeust that was being added to 
the queue it was also being dispatched as well which means that all requests 
were being dealt with. We also added print statements to declare when the direction flag had its value changed to show that we were in fact changing direction. With all of these things 
working as we expected them to we were able to prove that our look 
scheduler was properly working the way we wanted it to. 

\section{What we learned}
We learned that you have to make modification to multiple files when adding 
new features to the operating system. We also learned that writing code for 
the kernel can be hard and confusing because we could not find a lot of 
information on some of the built-in function being used so it took us some 
time trying to figure what they did and how they worked. We also learned that 
can be a ton of I/O requests and they can all happen very quickly. We also 
learned that there are many different ways to do the scheduling. 

\section{TA Evaluation}
First you must make clone a clean tree to apply our patch to. To do this you 
must clone this repo by using this command\\\\
git://git.yoctoproject.org/linux-yocto-3.19\\\\
in the directory that you want the repo. Then you will need to switch to the 
3.19.2 version by using this command.\\\\
git checkout -b linux-yocto-3.19.2\\\\
Next you will need to copy the config-3.19.2-yocto-qemu into a file called .config
from the files directroy into the linux-yocto-3.19 directory.
After you have copied the file in the linux-yocto-3.19 directory you will need to 
source the directory by using the following command\\\\
in bash shells use\\
source "path to files directory"/encironment-setup-i586-poky-linux\\
in tcsh shells use\\
source "path to files directory"/encironment-setup-i586-poky-linux.csh\\\\
Then apply our patch by\\\\
git apply sstfio.patch\\\\
after the patch is applied you will need to build the kernel by running\\\\
make -j4\\\\
Then you will need to run the VM with our bzImage which can be found in
the\\\\
linux-yocto-3.19\{\}arch\{\}x86\{\}boot\{\}bxImage
